# 🔒 Security Fixes Applied - TravelSpeak Family

## ✅ Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. **Rate Limiting** (Implemented ✓)
- Added middleware rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Limits per hour: translate (50), whisper (30), tts (50), ocr (20), auth (5)
- Additional rate limiting layer in `/app/api/lib/rateLimiter.js`
- Headers added to track remaining requests

### 2. **Cost Control** (Implemented ✓)
- Daily spending limit: $5 (configurable via `DAILY_COST_LIMIT`)
- Hourly spending limit: $2 (configurable via `HOURLY_COST_LIMIT`)
- Cost tracking in `/app/api/lib/costTracker.js`
- Real-time cost monitoring with headers in responses
- Alert threshold at $3/day

### 3. **Authentication Security** (Implemented ✓)
- Login attempt limiting (5 attempts per hour per IP)
- Secure token generation using crypto.randomBytes()
- Session expiration after 30 days
- HTTPOnly cookies for session management

### 4. **Security Headers** (Implemented ✓)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 5. **Error Handling** (Implemented ✓)
- Global error boundary in `/app/error.js`
- User-friendly error messages in Polish
- No stack traces exposed in production

### 6. **Recording Time Limit** (Implemented ✓)
- Reduced from 30s to 15s to control costs
- Saves ~50% on audio transcription costs

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Before Deployment

### 1. **Set Strong Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, set:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-[YOUR_NEW_KEY]
FAMILY_PASSWORD=[STRONG_PASSWORD_NOT_DEFAULT]
DAILY_COST_LIMIT=5.00
HOURLY_COST_LIMIT=2.00
ENABLE_OCR_FEATURE=true
```

### 2. **OpenAI Dashboard Settings**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. Set monthly spending limit: $50
3. Set alert threshold: $20
4. Monitor daily during trip

### 3. **Test All Security Features**
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..60}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/translate -d '{"text":"test","from":"pl","to":"en"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"; done

# Test login attempts
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth -d '{"password":"wrong"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"; done
```

## 📊 Monitoring During Trip

### Daily Checklist:
- [ ] Check OpenAI usage dashboard
- [ ] Review Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor response headers for cost info
- [ ] Check family WhatsApp for issues

### Cost Headers to Monitor:
```
X-Daily-Cost: 0.1234
X-Daily-Remaining: 4.8766
X-Hourly-Cost: 0.0456
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
```

### Emergency Procedures:
1. **High costs**: Disable OCR feature (`ENABLE_OCR_FEATURE=false`)
2. **Rate limit hit**: Reduce limits in middleware.js
3. **Auth issues**: Check login attempt logs
4. **API errors**: Check Railway logs, restart if needed

## 🎯 Expected Costs

| Feature | Cost per Use | Daily Estimate |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Translation | $0.004 | $0.40 (100 uses) |
| Speech-to-text | $0.003-0.006/min | $0.90 (5 min) |
| Text-to-speech | $0.001 | $0.10 (100 uses) |
| OCR | $0.01/image | $0.20 (20 images) |
| **Total** | - | **~$1.60/day** |

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your Railway app URL publicly**
2. **Use strong, unique family password**
3. **Rotate API key after trip**
4. **Monitor costs daily**
5. **Have Google Translate as backup**

## 📱 Family Testing Script

Before trip, test with each family member:
1. Login with family password
2. Record 15-second message
3. Test translation both directions
4. Test OCR with menu photo
5. Check offline phrases work

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] API key is NEW (not the exposed one)
- [ ] Family password is STRONG
- [ ] Cost limits are SET
- [ ] Rate limits are TESTED
- [ ] All family phones have app INSTALLED
- [ ] Offline phrases are CACHED
- [ ] Backup plan (Google Translate) READY
